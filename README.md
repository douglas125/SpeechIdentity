## How to use this repo

### Installation

**Environment:** I recommend setting up a separate environment to run this code. Install `requirements.txt` with conda and `pip_requirements.txt` with pip (basically, tensorflow dependencies).

**Data:** This repo uses Mozilla [Common Voice dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). I suggest downloading the English corpus (en.tar) into the `data` folder.
